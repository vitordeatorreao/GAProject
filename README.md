# GAProject
Source code for the Graph Algorithms' class project.

## Building the project
To build the project you must have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your computer. Once that is taken care of, run:
```
mvn package
```
This will download the necessary dependencies and build the library inside the folder `target`.
